# *My* REPL-STDIN Fonts
2 fonts based off of Replit's console arrow

---
> These fonts (2) are not to be mistaken with Replit's custom font which is used to render the console arrow: ![repl arrow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64909897/121921413-fba00c00-cd06-11eb-9c89-e13d8b3f9b8f.png)

I made both fonts to be very similar to what Replit uses *(for fun)* after making [this post](https://replit.com/talk/ask/The-console-stdin/141397)

Font maker I used: [BitFontMaker2](https://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/) (it's good for pixel fonts like these ones)

If you want to see all the included symbols then download either of the fonts, go to [FontDrop](https://fontdrop.info/), press `Or choose a file`, and open the font file.

### Glyphs:
